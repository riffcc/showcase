"It's Show Time!"

Showcase is a platform for sharing single video files and small galleries of images and videos.

It's built on Orbiter and Bit.dev and aims to offer a delightful showcase experience for the user.

It will provide adaptive streaming and voluntary seeding via IPFS Cluster.

## Features
* Adaptive streaming quality for a smooth experience
* Example configurations for IPFS Cluster to allow you to participate and seed for the network
* (Experimental) Helia peer for seeding directly on the network
* You can easily integrate content hosted on this platform into other websites and applications
    * or protect it with hotlinking protection to make sure it's not used without your permission

## Spotlight service

The Spotlight service is an *optional* service that allows you to pin your content to the IPFS network and ensure it stays online.

It's integrated into Showcase and allows you to make sure your content is fast and available.

It's planned to cost $5/month for a single lens with 100GB of storage, and $5/TB/month for additional storage.
